 ~5 min | 1 portion

- Oatmeal
- Yogurt
- Frozen berries (whichever you like)
- 5 Lotus Biscoff or Spekuloos

1. Put yogurt into a bowl, add oatmeal and mix. **Careful, don't add too much oatmeal, otherwise the cereal gets really dense and hard to eat!**
2. Add some frozen berries and mix.
3. Break the biscuits into pieces and mix into the cereal.

*Trust me this one is premium shit!*
