I'm tired of sending myself screenshots of my recipes when I need them on my phone, hence this repository.

I also fucking hate when people add shit into recipes that doesn't need to be there or explain things in an order that is confusing or even counter productive.

I also hate block text for recipes with a burning passion because I always forget where I was at.

To solve both of these problems at once I will be transcribing every recipe in a very strict format:

---
# Recipe Name
~XX min | X Portions

- List
- of
- ingredients
- in
- metric
- units

(Image, if applicable)

1. All steps of the cooking process described in separate numbered sections.
2. This way everything is in chronological order.
3. And it's easier to remember where you were at!

Should I at some point allow other people to submit recipes into this repo, I would ask you to respect this formatting.

Thank you and I hope you enjoy!
